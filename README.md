# LineMate

LineMate is an app built to help hockey coaches with the management of a hockey team. 

The goal of LineMate is to allow coaches to simplely and more easily track the team or teams they are coaching by allowing the coach to set lines, special teams, maintain an active roster of players on the team (With player details like: name, number, position, and what line they are on). 


Future plans for LineMate, in no particular order, include: 
- More detailed player profiles
- Create and upload custom practice plans 
- Create and manage events like practices, games, and tournaments

LineMate is build using:
- C#,
- .NET 5.0
- SQLServer
- JavaScript
- ReactJS
- ReactStrap
- Firebase for user authentication 


# To Run LineMate
1. Use `git clone <ssh key>` to clone the repository to your local machine
2. Seed the database with `linemate_create_db.sql` in the `SQL` directory
3. Run the backend in Visual Studio or prefered IDE 
4. Run the frontend using `npm start` from bash (make sure you are in the `client` directory of the project)



# Contact

If you've made it this far then I'm going to assume you actually have some sort of interest (or disgust) in my little app so if you
love it, hate it, want to help with it, want to tell me my app sucks. Then I'd love to hear from you!
